# EECS442SR
The course project of EECS442
## Roadmap
- [ ] Super resolution with CNN.
- [x] Super resolution (x4) with pre-trained diffusion model w/ classifier conditioning.
- [ ] Super resolution with codeformer.

## Diffusion Model

### EDM-DPS

You may find our pre-trained model of DIV2K based on EDM [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AGy7nSMq9UQgG0wZ6wg4DLWPS2o1vVtT/view?usp=sharing).

Run the sampling algorithm:

`python generate_sr.py`
